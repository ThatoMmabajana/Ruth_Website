                        Ruth Ramabu completed her Diploma and B-tech degree at Tswhane University of technology, she then
                        furthered her studies and completed a health science honours degree in Biokineticis at WITS. She is registered with the
                        Health professional council (HPCSA) and Biokineticist Assocoation of South Africa (BASA). Ruth has a long history of
                        sport and conditioning working for TUT High Perfromance Basketball and Netball, as well as working for the Midrand 
                        Back and Neck Centre and Physio and Wellness centre. She is also affiliated with non profit organisation Olieven

                            Ruth is a hard working empathetic individual who believes that exercise is medicine and is passionate about educating
                        everyone about the benefits of exercise and conditioning especially in development and elderly population and people 
                        with chronic and special population. She was inspired to become a biokineticist due to her love for sport and exercise 
                        as a child and unfortunately needing rehab herself due to injury. Her experience with her own injuries and still having
                        to go for treatment and living a healthy lifestyle to maintain her fitness helps her tackle her job with compassion
                        and understanding of pain management. More pain, no gain. Less pain, more gain. Re educating ourselves about progress
